# What is a Windows Domain and How Does It Affect My PC?

Windows domains manage a large number of PCs and can be controlled from one place by network administrators. Domains are typically used on large networks like corporate, school, and government networks. One or more servers (domain controllers) have control over the domain and the computers on it. Domains are generally made up of computers on the same local network but computers joined to a domain can continue communicating with their domain controller over a VPN or Internet connection. Domains limit what you can do on your PC since when your computer is part of a domain, the domain controller is in charge of what you can do. Network administrators can change group policy settings on the domain controller and each computer on the domain will get these settings which will override any local settings users specify on their PCs.  

You can quickly check whether your computer is part of a domain or not by opening the Control Panel, clicking the System and Security category, and clicking System > “Computer name, domain and workgroup settings”. If you see “Domain”: followed by the name of a domain, your computer is joined to a domain. You can leave a domain if you have local administrator access on your PC. Click the Change Settings link next to “Computer name, domain and workgroup settings” in the System information window to access the System Properties window, which allows you to join or leave a domain.

Every Windows computer not joined to a domain is part of a workgroup, which is a group of computers on the same local network. Unlike on a domain, no computer on a workgroup has control over any other computer as they’re all joined together and don't require a password.
