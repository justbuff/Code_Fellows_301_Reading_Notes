# Whatâ€™s the Difference Between Windows and Windows Server?

Microsoft Windows OS comes in desktop and server versions. Windows desktop and server editions look similar, but each has different uses. Windows 10 excels at everyday use, while Windows Server manages many computers, files, and services. Both versions can have the same desktop, start button, and task view button. They also both use the same kernel and can run the same software.

While Windows Server does have a desktop option, Microsoft recommends installing Windows Server without a GUI, leaving just a command line to work with which reduces the overhead needed to run the server. Nano Server is an option which drops the GUI and local login capabilities in exchange for using far less space than the standard Server install.

If the GUI is enabled, the Server Manager program can add on server-specific features like Windows Deployment services, DHCP services, and Active Directory Domain Services. These features allow deployment of an OS remotely to other machines, the creation of static IP address for client machines, control of a network domain for joining other computers to a domain, and creating domain users. Windows Server supports features like SMB Direct for faster file sharing and greater support for the Resilient File System. 

Windows Servers are designed to work in conjuntion and support more powerful hardware than the desktop verions, but do not  support signing in with a Microsoft account and use either local or domain accounts.
