# What is NGINX?

NGINX is open source software for web serving, caching, media streaming, and more. NGINX can function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers. NGINX can also be placed between clients and a second web server, to serve as an SSL/TLS terminator or web accelerator. 

NGINX uses event‑driven, asynchronous architecture, which revolutionized how servers operate in high‑performance contexts and became the fastest web server available. NGINX and NGINX Plus can handle hundreds of thousands of concurrent connections, and power more of the Internet’s busiest sites than any other server. NGINX supports all the components of the modern Web, including WebSocket, HTTP/2, gRPC, and streaming of multiple video formats (HDS, HLS, RTMP, and others).
 
As a software‑only all-in-one load balancer, web server, API gateway, and reverse proxy that is designed for cloud‑native architectures, NGINX helps accelerate IT infrastructure and application modernization efforts. NGINX Plus delivers enterprise‑grade capabilities that provide reliability and security.
