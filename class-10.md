# What is site-to-site VPN?

A site-to-site virtual private network (VPN) refers to a connection set up between multiple networks. Site-to-site VPNs are useful for companies that prioritize private, protected traffic and are particularly helpful for organizations with more than one office spread out over large geographical locations. In many cases, big companies must send many terabytes of data between locations, quickly and safely, and the kind of VPN sufficient for a normal torrent user or web surfer would not be able to handle the workload.

## Types of VPNs

- Remote Access: a temporary VPN connection is set up between two or more users and a central location. 

- Intranet-based Site-to-Site: connects more than one local-area network (LAN) to form a wide-area network (WAN).

- Extranet-based Site-to-Site: each entity connects to the VPN and chooses what they want to make available to the other companies.

- Internet-based site-to-site: uses the existing network of an organization in combination with the public internet. To create an internet-based site-to-site VPN, you make a tunnel that connects two networks, for which you need three components: A base network in one location, a satellite network in another location, and a tunnel with security gateways on each end.

- MPLS Site-to-Site: depends on infrastructure made available by the VPN provider, as opposed to the company that uses the VPN. MPLS works through labels that route data packets to where they need to go instead of using IP addresses. Nodes are designed to interpret the labels and send the data packets directly to the next destination.

## Key components of site-to-site VPNs

- Security: A VPN with properly programmed gateways will only let data through if it has the appropriate authentication. Otherwise, it is discarded, which, in many cases, keeps the network safe.

- Ease of Operations: Users should have the freedom to access the VPN using a web browser. 

- Simple and Secure Scalability: You can add a new site, user, office, or partner organization in minutes.

- Business Continuity: A site-to-site VPN lets you leverage remote access immediately after an emergency has been identified. 

- Flexible Deployment: With a VPN, you have the power to deploy a new solution across a broad network of devices at various physical locations.
