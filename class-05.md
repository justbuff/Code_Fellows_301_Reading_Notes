# What and When is Patch Tuesday for Windows?

## What Is Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday?

Sometimes called “Update Tuesday,” Patch Tuesday is an unofficial term for the day when Microsoft releases update packages for the Windows operating system and other Microsoft software applications, including Microsoft Office. Microsoft does this to make the update process as predictable as possible for administrators. 

## When Is Patch Tuesday?

Patch Tuesday occurs on the second Tuesday of each month in North America. Microsoft doesn’t have a guaranteed time these patches are released, but they generally arrive around 10 a.m. Pacific Standard Time.

Windows 10 checks for updates about once per day. The average Windows PC should automatically download these updates via Windows Update by Wednesday afternoon if it’s powered on and connected to the internet.

In some cases, Microsoft will issue updates seperate from Patch Tuesday for particularly critical security flaws, especially ones that are being exploited in the wild. Large Windows updates are also released seperately from Patch Tuesday.

Patch Tuesday updates are called “B” updates because they’re released in the second week of each month. Microsoft also issues optional update packages in the third or fourth weeks of the month, known as the “C” and “D” updates. These include bug fixes and improvements for problems that aren’t security holes. These C and D updates now appear as “optional updates” in Windows Update on Windows 10.

Other companies have chosen to join Patch Tuesday, like Adobe.
